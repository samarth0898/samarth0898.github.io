I am a Research Engineer at [SRA, Digital Media Solutions Lab](https://sra.samsung.com/research-area/digital-media/) focused on applying signal processing and machine learning techniques to advance the capabilities of next-generation multimedia devices.

Before joining SRA, I was at [CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) for 2+ years working with Richard Stern, and completing my masters in [Music & Tech](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/mat/about.html) (2023). I also worked at [Dolby Laboratories](https://www.dolby.com/) as a Sound Tech Research Intern in the ATG, working mostly on spatial audio and plulgin development. Prior to CMU, I also worked at [IISc, Speech and Audio Signal Processing Lab](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/speech-and-audio-signal-processing-lab/), in areas of signals and acoustics. 

My academic background encompasses a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and digital signal processing. I have applied this knowledge through research, including extensive work in multi-modal machine learning involving audio, video, and their fusion. My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and signal processing, where I seek to explore innovative solutions for complex problems.
